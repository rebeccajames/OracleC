Some of the reasons vulnerabilities exist in the EG include the lack of security
like executable exploit mitigations, the presence of vendor backdoors, continued 
use of 1990â€™s network interface cards, and the inability to easily patch/update 
the systems.  Because a lot of these vulnerabilities are documented, off the 
shelf repositories of known weaknesses and exploitation models/packages are 
available to assist hackers in attacking systems.  The availability of these 
tools increases the chance for attack.  A report published May 2013, by the 
U.S. House of Representatives [1], suggests that in the future, threats against 
CPS are more likely than physical damage from detonation of an 
Electromagnetic Pulse (EMP) device.
